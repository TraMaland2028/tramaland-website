Introduction
1.TRML Shit Manifesto
Why TRML?
Beats me, it just felt right. 
Or "Why the Hell Are We Still Building This Crap While You're Busy Getting Rekt on 10/10"Tired?
Of course you're tired.  Because price isn't value.
It's just somebody's faith + somebody's leverage + somebody's tweet.  October 10, 2025:
$19 billion wiped out in 40 minutes.
$3.21 billion — in one single minute.
1.6 million people liquidated.
A politician tweeted about tariffs — and boom, crypto winter.  And you?
You were sitting in a 50x long screaming "to the moon"?
Now you're rotting in the basement waiting for the 2028 halving.
Congrats, genius.  Crypto isn't freedom.
It's a casino with a pretty logo.
Exchanges profit off your liquidations.
Whales feast on your stops.
Regulators choke on your fear.
And you? Cannon fodder.  TRML?
Not for pumps or hype.
Not "100x to the moon".
Just an index of real shit: oil, gas, gold, wheat, copper.
The stuff factories and people actually consume.
Not what bots and Twitter gurus feed on.  Our token?
Non-tradable. No order book. No pump.
No "buy the dip and sell the rip" bullshit.
Just a share in the basket of life.
So your years don't dissolve in the next 10/10 wipeout.  Why this might die?
Because people love chaos.
Love 100x.
Love blowing everything up in one minute and blaming someone else.
And they hate measuring.
It's easier to believe in a "new era" than to count the hours of your own life.  
But if you're sick of being part of this circus —
Join in.
Check the data yourself (everything's open).
Run a script that tracks the index.
Use TRML in a real contract with someone else who's fed up.
Tell three friends who also got rekt on 10/10.  This isn't an investment.
It's a rebellion.
Small, stubborn, with zero chance of quick cash.
But the only one that doesn't end with your liquidation.  
Why this actually makes sense (no rose-tinted glasses)
Crypto right now is pure faith + leverage + whale/politician tweets → price can 
rocket to the moon or zero out in 40 minutes (just like October 2025).  
Real commodities aren't pure faith.
There are factories eating copper; people eating wheat; machines drinking oil.
Speculation exists, sure, but there's a physical anchor: production, demand, 
logistics, wars, weather. It's much harder to completely detach from reality.  
TRML takes prices of these goods (futures + spot for metals) → builds an index.
→ You get a digital tag: "how much the basic basket of life costs today",
not "how much people believe in this meme".  What does this make easier for people?
Preserve effort without inflation/devaluation → your accumulated "hours of life" 
don't melt away in dollar/euro/whatever printing.
Negotiate without middlemen → "let's calculate debt/salary/rent in 
TRML units based on the current index" → voluntary, no exchange, no pump.
Stop waiting for the moon → no speculation on upside, just measuring "what's 
happening in the real world right now".
Transparency → data open (Yahoo Finance etc.), code public, 
calculation automatic → anyone can verify, no blind trust.  Is it really simpler?
For most people — yes, because:
No need to dive into DeFi, leverage, yield farming.
No fear the token dumps 90% on a random tweet.
Just: "My TRML is a share in the oil+grain+metals basket. 
If the world gets more expensive — my share does too."  
The downsides are obvious (and you know them):
If nobody uses it in real agreements → it stays a pretty number on a website.
Data can lag/get distorted.
No hype → no viral growth → project can quietly fade away.  
But that's exactly the point:
Not building another casino, but a tool for people tired of casinos.  
Join or keep waiting for the next "10/10".
Your choice.
Our GitHub is open.
Data is public.
Nobody's forcing you.
But if not you — then who?


2. TRML Calculation Methodology
2.1 Basket Composition (Version v1.0)

The current TRML basket reflects the foundational raw materials of the global economy.

Energy

WTI Crude Oil (CL=F) — 20%
Natural Gas (NG=F) — 8%

Industrial and Precious Metals

Gold (GC=F) — 11%
Silver (SI=F) — 7%
Copper (HG=F) — 11%
Platinum (PL=F) — 7%

Agriculture

Wheat (ZW=F) — 9%
Corn (ZC=F) — 8%
Soybeans (ZS=F) — 7%
Coffee (KC=F) — 4%
Sugar (SB=F) — 4%
Cotton (CT=F) — 4%

Total basket weight — 100%.

Why the Basket Uses Tickers with “=F”

The TRML index uses designations such as CL=F, GC=F, ZW=F, etc.

“=F” is a technical market ticker format that allows for consistent 
and standardized data retrieval across the entire basket.

This does not mean the index is “about futures traders.”
It means a unified and comparable source of quotations 
has been selected for all basket components.

For certain assets, a hybrid approach is already applied. For gold, silver, 
and platinum, the calculation incorporates not only futures data but also spot data.

This reduces distortions and makes the resulting index more closely aligned with 
the actual dynamics of the underlying commodity basket.

Conclusion

“=F” in the ticker is a data format.
The purpose of the index is to measure changes 
in the cost of a base commodity basket.
Where possible, spot pricing has already been incorporated into 
the calculation to improve the accuracy of the result.

2.2 Calculation Principle
FORMULAS USED IN THE TRML-base SERVICE

1. Relative price per asset

r_i = P_i(t) / P_i(0)

Where:
P_i(t) = current asset price
P_i(0) = base price (on launch day)

2. Hybrid futures + spot (for GC, SI, PL)

First calculated:

r_i_fut = P_i_fut(t) / P_i_fut(0)
r_i_spot = P_i_spot(t) / P_i_spot(0)

Then logarithmic blending is applied:

r_i_hyb = exp( (1 - alpha) * ln(r_i_fut)

alpha * ln(r_i_spot) )

Where:
alpha = 0.5

3. Weighted geometric basket index

L = SUM( w_i * ln(r_i) )

If part of the data is missing:

L_norm = L / SUM(w_i_covered)

Index(t) = BaseIndex * exp(L_norm)

BaseIndex = 1,000,000
Minimum data coverage: 85%

4. Basket coefficient

K_raw = Index(t) / BaseIndex

5. EMA7 smoothing

K_ema7(t) = alpha_ema * K_raw(t)

(1 - alpha_ema) * K_ema7(t - 1)

alpha_ema = 2 / (7 + 1) = 0.25

6. USD purchasing power

PP_raw = 1 / K_raw
PP_ema7 = 1 / K_ema7

7. Percentage change

Delta_K_percent = (K_raw - 1) * 100
Delta_PP_percent = (PP_raw - 1) * 100

8. JSON values (as implemented in code)

TRML_USD_raw = 1,000,000 * K_raw
TRML_USD_ema = 1,000,000 * K_ema7

9. Simple Moving Average (SMA)

SMA_n = (1 / n) * SUM_{k=0 to n-1} Index(t - k)

n belongs to the set {7, 30}

10. Daily change cap (anti-noise filter)

P_i(t) belongs to the range:

[ P_ref * (1 - 0.15) , P_ref * (1 + 0.15) ]

MAX_DAILY_MOVE = 15%

2.3 Purchasing Power
CALCULATION OF THE BASKET COEFFICIENT AND PURCHASING POWER

First, the basket coefficient is calculated:

K = Index / BaseIndex

Where:
BaseIndex = 1,000,000

USD Purchasing Power

PP_USD = 1 / K

Change in Purchasing Power Relative to Base (%)

Delta_PP_percent = (PP_USD - 1) * 100

EXAMPLES

1. If:

K = 1.10
(the basket increased by 10%)

Then:

PP_USD = 1 / 1.10 = 0.909

Delta_PP_percent = (0.909 - 1) * 100
= -9.1%

The dollar has weakened relative to the basket.

2. If:

K = 0.90

Then:

PP_USD = 1 / 0.90 = 1.111

Delta_PP_percent = (1.111 - 1) * 100
= +11.1%

The dollar has strengthened relative to the basket.

An increase in K reflects a rise in the commodity basket price and a decline 
in the purchasing power of nominal currency relative to core resources.

2.4 Hybrid Quotes

For gold, silver, and platinum, a hybrid valuation mechanism is applied:

50% — futures quotation
50% — spot quotation

This reduces potential distortions associated with futures market structure 
(contango, backwardation).

2.5 Data Sources

At the current stage, open market data sources are used.

The calculation is performed algorithmically without manual adjustments.

3. Current Status

TRML v1.0 is a test version of the methodology.

If a stable audience forms and interest grows:

the basket may be expanded with additional components,

the mechanism may be refined,

data sources may be migrated to professional paid APIs,

the calculation may undergo external verification.

Any changes to the methodology will be publicly documented.
(At the moment, there simply isn’t funding for a full-scale launch.)

3.1 Model Limitations

TRML:

reflects only the commodity sector,

does not account for services or technological assets,

depends on the quality of market data,

is not an official economic index.

The model is published as an open algorithmic methodology.

3.2 Index Scale and Community Calculation Axis

On the launch day, the TRML index was normalized to the value:

TRML_launch = 1,000,000

This value serves as a scaling reference point and is used solely 
for convenience in displaying dynamics.

The number 1,000,000:

is not a fixed price,

does not create exchange obligations.

It is the initial index level.

Relative Unit

TRML measures the change in the value of the commodity basket 
relative to the starting level.

Thus:

1,100,000 indicates a 10% increase in the basket
900,000 indicates a 10% decrease

The index expresses the relative change in real resources.

3.3 Collective Calculation Interpretation

TRML does not assign a price and does not set an exchange rate.

However, participants may, by mutual agreement, use the index as 
a calculation axis for internal arrangements.

For example, parties may agree that:

the value 1,000,000 corresponds to a conventional base unit,

the current index value reflects its relative change.

Such usage:

is not prescribed by the protocol,

is not mandatory,

is not guaranteed to third parties,

exists solely as a form of voluntary agreement between participants.

TRML publishes a number.
A number becomes a measure only when people accept it as one.

4. TRML Index and TRML Token

TRML consists of two layers:

TRML Index — an algorithmic indicator of changes in the commodity basket.

TRML Token:

is not a collateralized asset,

does not represent a share in a fund,

does not guarantee returns,

does not create claims on any assets,

is not a means of payment.

The token is not “backed” by the index.

It is connected to the index conceptually and informationally.

4.1 Relationship to the Index

The TRML index publishes a coefficient reflecting changes in the commodity base.

The token may be used by participants as a digital unit whose 
value is interpreted relative to the index.

The protocol does not fix an exchange rate between the token 
and the index and does not guarantee alignment between them.

However, participants may, by mutual agreement, reference the index value w
hen determining the settlement value of the token within their own arrangements.

4.2 Voluntary Interpretation Model

The community may consider:

1 TRML Token as a conventional unit,

the index value as a dynamic scale reflecting changes in that unit.

Such a model:

is not legally закрепed,

is not mandatory,

does not create exchange guarantees,

exists exclusively within the framework of voluntary agreement among participants.

The index publishes a measurement.
The token allows participants to operate with that measurement in digital form.

5. Position Toward the Crypto Growth Model

TRML did not emerge as an attempt to compete with existing cryptocurrencies.

It emerged from observing their evolution.

In recent years, digital assets have increasingly become objects of exponential 
growth expectations. 
Endless anticipation of BTC reaching $1,000,000.

In many cases, value has come to be measured not by usage 
or fundamentals, but by forecasts of future price.

Forecasts tend to move in one direction. Reality often moves in another.

At the same time, significant computational power, electricity, 
and material resources are allocated to maintaining networks whose primary function 
is the confirmation of numerical records in distributed ledgers.

One question follows: is this the optimal allocation of resources?

TRML does not classify these models as “right” or “wrong.”
It proposes an alternative vector.

Instead of waiting decades for hypothetical price levels, 
TRML focuses on measuring the present state of the real commodity base.

Instead of consuming resources in pursuit of abstract valuation growth, 
TRML publishes a coefficient reflecting changes in the already existing material structure of the economy.

TRML is not built on hash rate competition, emission schedules, or computational scarcity.
It is built on a transparent formula and minimal algorithmic calculation.

TRML does not bet on a future price. It records current dynamics.

6. Technological Environment: Why Polygon

TRML exists in a digital environment, and the choice of that environment matters.

For the digital implementation of the project, the Polygon network was selected as 
infrastructure offering low transaction costs, fast confirmation times, 
and a resilient ecosystem.

TRML does not require energy-intensive computational mechanisms.
Its logic is measurement, not mining.

Polygon operates on a consensus model designed 
for efficiency and scalability, allowing it to:

minimize energy consumption,

provide fast confirmations,

reduce interaction costs,

avoid network congestion.

This aligns with the TRML philosophy:

fewer redundant computations,

fewer barriers,

greater accessibility.

Ecosystem

Polygon provides mature infrastructure:

compatibility with Ethereum,

a developed tooling ecosystem,

stable smart contract execution,

broad integration with wallets and services.

TRML does not aim to create its own computational race.
It uses existing digital infrastructure optimized 
for practical application.

7. Transactions and Network Gas

Like any digital asset on the Polygon network, 
TRML operates through the standard blockchain transaction mechanism.

To perform operations, including transfers or smart contract interactions, 
a network fee must be paid. This fee is known as gas.

On the Polygon network, gas is paid in the native network token, POL.

This is a technical requirement of the blockchain infrastructure, 
not a feature specific to TRML.

TRML:

does not charge its own fees,

does not control gas costs,

does not receive network fee revenue.

Gas cost is determined by network congestion and Polygon protocol parameters.

Principle of Transparency

Any interaction with TRML on-chain:

requires a minimal amount of POL to pay for the transaction,

is executed directly by the user,

does not involve a centralized intermediary.

TRML uses existing infrastructure.
The network fee is a payment for recording data in a distributed ledger, 
not an internal economic model of the project.

Conclusion

TRML is a public experiment.
Participation is entirely voluntary.

Starting Point

If you are here, perhaps you already understand why.

You receive a reference point for an alternative framework.

The essential part lies slightly deeper, beyond the surface layer of text.

Why It Spreads

TRML will not become valuable because of its price.
It will become valuable only if it is recognized.

Each new participant does not increase someone’s profit.
They increase the strength of a shared agreement.

You are not distributing a token.
You are distributing an idea.

The idea that things can be structured differently.

That is all.
